# Ramda extras

[Ramda.js](http://www.ramdajs.com) is great!

But those people have a high morale, which is a good thing :), and don't add functions unless there is a nice way of doing so. For instance there is no [`maxIn`](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1334) ~~`pathOr`~~ (since 0.18 there is!), ~~`dropLast`~~ (since 0.16 there is!), ~~`isEmptyObj`~~ (since version ?, isEmpty works for objects too).

Basically ramda-extras contains the functions I feel a need for but for some reason is not added in ramda. It also contains the `cc` and `ccp` functions that provide very nice syntactic sugar when composing stuff in CoffeeScript.
