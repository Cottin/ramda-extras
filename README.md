# Ramda extras

[Ramda.js](http://www.ramdajs.com) is great!

But being widely popular, it's kept simple and focused not to get to bloated from all feature requests. For instance there is no `maxIn` [(and here is why)](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/1334), ~~`pathOr`~~ (since 0.18 there is!), ~~`dropLast`~~ (since 0.16 there is!), ~~`isEmptyObj`~~ (now `isEmpty` actually handles objects too).

Basically ramda-extras contains the functions I feel a need for but for some reason is not added in ramda.
